# React Recipe Share 🍅 🍎

### What's Inside
This is a web application to share recipes with friends. The app uses React as its JS framework and Firebase as its database. React Router v4 is also used to switch between the main page and individual recipes.

You can view all the recipes using the app. But, to add your own recipes and edit recipes, you need to create an account.
