# React Recipe Share 🍅 🍎

### What's Inside
This is a web application to share recipes with friends. The app uses React as its JS framework and Firebase as its database. React Router v4 is also used to switch between the main page and individual recipes. A google login is required to access the app and each user is only able to edit their own recipes.
